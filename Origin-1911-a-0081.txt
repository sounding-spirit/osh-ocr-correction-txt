LEANDER.  C.  M. 
“  Then  answered  Peter  and  said  unto  him,  Behold,  we  have  forsaken  all,  and  followed  thee.”—Matt.  19  :  27.

1.  My  soul  for-sakes  her  vain  de-light,  And  bids  the  world  fare  -  well; 
Base  as  the  dirt  be-neath  the  feet,  And  mis-chie  ■  vous  as  hell. 
2.  There’s  nothing  round  this  spacious  earth  That  suits  my  soul’s  de  -  sire; 
To  bound-less  joy 
and  sol  -  id  mirth  My  no-bler  thoughts  as  -  pire.

No  Ion  -  ger  will  I  ask  your  love,  Nor  seek  your  friend-ship  more;  The  hap  -  pi-ness  that 
ap-prove  Is  not  with-in  your  pow’r.  pow’r.

Oh,  for  the  pin  -  ions  of  a  dove  To  mount  the  heav’n-ly  road;  There  shall  I  share  my  Sav-iour’s  love,  There  shall  I  dwell  with  God.  God. 
The  above  is  one  of  Isaac  Watts’  hymns,  and  is  supposed  to  have  been  composed  about  1707-  The  exact  date,  however,  is  hard  to  ascertain. 
“Leander”  is  a  very  old  tune,  and  dates  early  in  the  nineteenth  century,  and  can  be  found  in  most  American  song  books.  See  Southern  Harmony,”  by 
Walker,  1835,  page  128.  It  is  credited  in  that  book  to  Austin.  We  can  find  no  information  concerning  him.  See  also  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  1837,  page  129.
