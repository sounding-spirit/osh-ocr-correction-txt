The  original  title  of  this  hymn  in  “Olney’s  Selections”  is  “Faith’s  Review  and  Expectation.”  John  Newton  lived  in  wickedness  a  long  time,  but  finally 
turned  to  the  work  of  his  Lord  and  Master,  and  entered  the  ministry,  and  was  a  power  as  a  preacher,  poet,  and  hymn  writer.  He  expresses  his  feelings  at  the  time 
he  wrote  the  hymn,  “  Amazing  grace,  how  sweet  the  sound,  That  saved  a  wretch  like  me  !”  He  was  born  in  1725  and  died  in  1807.  He  was  a  minister  in  the 
Church  of  England. 
We  have  been  unable  to  find  the  name  of  the  author  of  the  above  tune.  There  are  numerous  claimants  of  it,  but  after  investigation  there  are  doubts  as  to  who 
is  really  the  author.  The  tune  appears  on  page  8  of  “  Southern  Harmony,”  by  William  Walker,  in  1835.  It  is  believed  that  it  was  composed  early  in  the  nineteenth 
century.  The  name  of  “  New  Britain  ”  is  suggestive  of  the  source  of  the  origin  of  the  tune,  but  no  author  is  given  in  any  of  the  books  we  have  examined  of  the 
music.  Copyright,  1909,  by  J.  S.  James.

“  I  will  cry  unto  God  most  high.”—Ps,  57  :  2. 
O  Thou  who  hear’st  when  sinners  cry,  Tho’  all  my  crimes  before  Thee  lie,Be-hold  them  not  with  an-gry  look,  But  blot  their  mem-’ry  from  Thy  book. 
The  above  tune  and  words  appear  in  the  Fifty-first  Psalm,  Watts  ;  “  Southern  Harmony,”  1835,  page  5  ;  also  in  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  in  1837,  page  26.  The 
words  appear  in  the  “  Baptist  Hvmnal,”  1833,  No.  296;  page  95  of  Watts’  “  Hymns,”  1719.  We  find  no  trace  of  the  author  of  the  tune.  It  was  published  in  the 
“  Sacred  Harp,”  by  White  and  King,  from  1844  to  1869.
