22.  Should  this  order  be  observed  in  descending? 
It  should. 
23.  What  are  the  keys  in  the  minor  scale? 
A,  E,  B.  F  sharp  minor,  C  sharp  minor,  G  sharp  minor,  D  sharp  minor, 
D  minor,  G  minor,  C  minor,  F  minor,  Bb  minor,  Eb  minor. 
LESSON  VI. 
1.  Mow  many  tones  form  a  scale? 
Eight  tones  arranged  in  a  certain  order  form  a  scale. 
2.  How  are  these  tones  arranged? 
They  are  arranged  in  an  ascending  series  from  one  to  eight,  thus:  1,  2, 
3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8.  This  forms  a  scale,  if  the  distance  between  three  and  four 
and  seven  and  eight  is  only  half  as  great  as  the  other  distances  between  any 
two  succeeding  tones.  Of  the  descending  series  they  run,  8,  7,  6,  5,  4,  3,  2,  1. 
3.  What  are  the  large  and  small  distances  in  the  scale  called? 
For  the  sake  of  convenience  they  are  called  steps  and  half-steps. 
4.  How  many  steps  and  half-steps  are  there  in  the  scale? 
There  are  five  whole  steps  and  two  half-steps. 
5.  Can  you  define  the  Diatonic  Major  scale? 
The  Diatonic  Major  scale  is  a  scale  of  eight  primary  tones  and  seven 
intervalsâ€”five  whole  steps  and  two  half-steps,  the  half-steps  occurring  between 
3  and  4  and  7  and  8.  Between  all  of  the  other  numbers  whole  steps.  (See

6.  Does  every  musical  tone  have  a  names? 
Yes,  every  tone,  it  matters  not  how  high  or  how  low,  it  bears  a  name.  The 
names  of  the  tones  of  the  scale  are  as  follows:

1.  Does  the  minor  key  have  the  same  signatures  of  the  major  keys? 
They  do;  they  have  no  separate  signatures. 
2.  Does  every  major  diatonic  scale  have  a  relative  minor  scale  bearing  the 
same  signature. 
They  do. 
3.  Explain  how  this  is.  The  sixth  tone  of  any  major  key  will  give  the 
relaitve  minor  key.  This  can  be  done  by  counting  down  a  third  from  the 
major  key  note.  This  is  called  a  minor  third. 
5.  When  is  a  scale  said  to  be  relative  to  another? 
When  they  are  composed  of  the  same  identical  tones. 
6.  On  what  does  the  minor  scale  commence? 
On  what  is  called  a  minor  third  or  a  step  and  a  half  above  the  minor. 
6.  On  what  does  the  minor  scale  commence? 
A  step  and  a  half  below  the  major. 
7.  Why  are  they  called  Major  and  Minor  scales? 
On  account  of  the  above  statements  in  the  ascending  minor  scale  from
