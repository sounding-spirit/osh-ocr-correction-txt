i.  Sal  -  va-tion,  O  the  joy  -  ful  sound,’Tis  pleas-ure  to  our  ears;  A  sov’reign  balm  for  ev  -’ry  wound,  A  cor-dial  for  our  fears. 
2.  Bur  -  ied  in  sor  -  row  and  in  sin,  At  hell’s  dark  door  we  lay;  But  we  a  -  rise  by  grace  di  -  vine,  To  see  a  heav’n-ly  day. 
3.  Sal  -  va-tion!  let  the  ech  -  0  fly  The  spac-ious  earth  a-round;  While  all  the  ar  -  mies  of  the  sky  Con-spire  to  raise  the  sound. 
First  published  in  the  author’s  “  Hymns  and  Spiritual  Songs,”  under  the  title  of  “  Salvation.”  Walter  Shirley,  it  is  thought,  added  the  fourth  verse  to  this 
hymn  in  1774.  It  appeared  in  Lady  Huntingdon’s  “Selections,”  of  which  he  was  at  the  time  editor.  This  hymn  is  said  also  to  be  approved  and  indorsed  by  the 
leading  church  denominations  of  America.  See  “  National  Hymn  Book,”  page  14.  Lyrically  speaking,  it  is  correct,  and  has  literary  excellence,  fair  propriety, 
reverence,  and  spiritual  reality.  Isaac  Watts  was  born  in  1674  and  died  in  1748.  He  was  a  minister  in  the  English  Congregationalist  Church. 
This  tune  was  printed  in  the  “  Southern  Harmony,”  in  1835,  page  3,  by  William  Walker;  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  in  1837,  page  21,  as  well  as  in  many  other 
earlier  books.  Amzi  Chopin  was  born  in  1768.  He  composed  a  great  deal  of  sacred  music,  and  was  a  splendid  musician.  copyright,  1908,  by  j.  s.  James.

4.  Waked  by  the  trum-pet  sound,  I  from  my  grave  shall  rise;  And  see  the  Judge  with  gio  -  ry  crowned,  And  see  the  flam-ing  skies! 
The  original  title  to  these  words  was  “  And  Others  of  Riper  Years.”  See  history  of  Charles  Wesley  on  this  and  other  pages  of  this  work.  He  composed  over 
6,ooo  hymns,  and  this  one  was  among  his  favorites. 
“Idumea”  was  printed  in  Walker’s  “Southern  Harmony,”  in  1835  >  page  31;  Missouri  Harmony,  in  1837,  page  32.  It  was  first  published  in  1817.  No 
trace  can  be  found  of  A.  Davidson,  author  of  the  music.
