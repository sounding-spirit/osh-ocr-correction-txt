Joseph  Hart  was  born  in  1712  and  died  in  1768.  After  being  a  backslider  from  his  early  religious  training,  he  heard  John  Wesley  preach  in  1757.  He  became 
converted,  and  began  at  once  to  preach  himself,  and  continued  up  to  the  time  of  his  death.  He  composed  a  large  number  of  valuable  hymns,  and  published 
religious  works.  This  tune  is  one  of  the  old  melodies,  but  none  of  the  books  we  have  seen  give  the  date  or  the  name  of  the  author  of  the  music.

3.  Hail,  the  holy  Prince  of  peace!  Hail,  the  Sun  of  righteousness,  Light  and  life  to  all  He  brings,Risen  with  healing  in  His  wings.

“  Cookham”  is  among  the  oldest  American  tunes,  selected  from  “  Baptist  Harmony,”  page  327.  See  “  Southern  Harmony,”  by  William  Walker,  page  8,  1835. 
The  above  hymn  is  claimed  by  the  English  people  as  being  the  best  hymn  Charles  Wesley  ever  wrote.  See  Duffield’s  “  English  Hymns,”  page  207.  Full  history 
by  Rev.  David  R.  Breev,  in  his  work  on  the  “  Use  of  Hymns  and  Tunes,”  pages  115  and  116;  also  “Anglican  Hymnology.”  In  the  “Standard  Hymn  Book  of 
the  United  States  ”  it  is  put  down  as  one  of  the  greatest  hymns  in  the  world.  See  page  39.  Rev.  Lewis  F.  Benson,  D.  D.,  in  work  on  “  Best  Church  Hymns,” 
page  17,  puts  this  hymn  as  number  eight  of  all  American  hymns.  Some  authors  place  it  as  number  one.
