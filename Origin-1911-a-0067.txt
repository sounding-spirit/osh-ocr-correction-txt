The  hymn  in  the  above  tune  was  first  entitled  “  Holy  Fortitude.”  It  was  published  after  Mr.  Watts  had  preached  a  sermon  from  First  Corinthians  16:  13  fa 
1709.  We  can  find  no  data  whatever  of  Mr.  Price,  the  author  of  the  music.  It  was  published  by  William  Walker,  in  “  Southern  Harmony,”  page  45,  1835.  ’
