“I/Jok  not  thou  upon  the  wine  when  it  is  red.”—Prov.  23:  31 
i.  Throughout  our  wide-spread  union,  What  cheering  scenes  arise,  The  temp’rance  flag  is  waving  Where’er  we  turn  our  eyes,  Bright  in  the  South  ’tis  floating,  The 
North  has  raised  it  high, 
The  East  and  West  unfurl  it,  The  East  and  West  unfurl  it,  .  The  East  and  West  unfurl  it,  In  gio  -  ry  to  the  skies. 
2  Ten  thousand  times  ten  thousand 
Around  her  banner  stand, 
Resolved  to  drive  intemperance 
From  our  beloved  land. 
From  every  rolling  river, 
From  city,  town,  and  plain— 
The  cry  is  heard,  Deliver 
From  rum’s  destructive  reign. 
3  What  though  the  gifts  of  Heaven 
On  every  hand  abound, 
And  God’s  abundant  blessing 
Our  dear-loved  nation  crown— 
In  vain,  with  lavished  kindness, 
Do  all  these  blessings  come, 
While  drunkards,in  their  blindness, 
Bow  down,  the  slaves  of  rum. 
4  Shall  we,  whose  souls  are  lighted 
With  ardour  from  on  high,— 
Shall  we,  to  men  benighted, 
The  helping  hand  deny; 
No,  no  !  our  tongues,  unceasing, 
Deliverance  shall  proclaim, 
Till  not  one  erring  mortal 
Shall  hear  the  drunkard’s  shame. 
5  Waft,  waft,  ye  winds,  the  story, 
And  you,  ye  waters,  roll, 
Till,  like  a  sea  of  glory, 
It  spreads  from  pole  to  pole, 
Till  the  last  wretched  drunkard 
His  liberty  shall  gain, 
And  temperance,  all  victorious, 
Throughout  the  nation  reign. 
This  is  one  of  the  early  tunes  on  the  subject  of  temperance,  but  the  author  of  the  music  and  words  is  unknown,
