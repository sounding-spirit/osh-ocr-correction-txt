WINTER.  C.  M. 
“  And  it  was  at  Jerusalem  the  feast  of  the  dedication,  and  it  was  winter.’’—John  10  :  22. 
Daniee  Reed,  1785. 
His  hoar-y  frost,  his  fleec  -  y  snow,  De-scend  and  clothe  the  ground;  The  liquid  streams  for  -  bear  to  flow,  In  ic  -  y  fet  -  ters  bound. 
'See  history  of  Daniel  Reed  under  tune  of  “Windham.”  “Winter”  appears  in  the  “  Southern  Harmony,’-’  in  1835,  page  293;  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  1837,

WINDHAM.  L.  M. 
“  Wide  is  the  gate,  broad  is  the  way  that  leadeth  to  destruction.  Straight  is  the  gate,  narrow  is  the  way  that  leadeth  unto  life.”—Matt.  7:  13,  14. 
Isaac  Watt,  1709.  Key  of  B  Minor.  s  Daniee  Read,  1785. 
i.  Broad  is  the  road  that  leads  to  death 
And  thou-sands  walk  togeth  -  er  there;  But  wisdom  shows  a  nar  -  row  path,  With  here  and  there  a  trav-’ler. 
2.  “De-ny  thy-self,  and-take  thy  cross,” 
Is  the  Re-deemer’s  great  command;  Na-ture  must  count  her  gold  but  dross,  If  she  would  gain  this  heav’nly  land. 
3.  The  fear-ful  soul  that  tires  and  faints, 
And  walks  the  ways  of  God  no  more,  Is  but  es-teemed  al  -  most  a  saint,  And  makes  his  own  destruc  -  tion  sure. 
4.  Lord,  let  not  all  my  hopes  be  vain,  Cre  -  ate  my  heart  en-tire  -  ly  new,  Which  hy-po-crites  cou’dne’er  at-tain,  Which  false  apostates  nev-er  knew. 
Daniel  Reed,  the  author  of  the  music,  was  born  1757.  He  published  the  “American  Song  Book,”  in  1785,  “  Columbia  Harmony,”  1793.  He  also  compiled 
and  published  several  other  selections.  He  died  at  New  Haven,  Conn.,  1836.  The  music  first  appeared  in  the  “American  Singing  Book.”  He  is  the  author  of 
a  number  of  standard  tunes,  “Sherburn,”  “Russia,”  “Stafford,”  and  other  psalmodies.  He  is  an  American  composer. 
Dr.  Watts  at  the  time  he  wrote  this  hymn,  was  engaged  in  writing  church  music,  and  a  large  number  of  hymns  are  dated  about  this  time,  200  years  ago.
