He  dies,  the  Friend  of  sinners  dies!  Lo  Salem’s  daughters  weep  around: 
A  solemn  darkness  veils  the  skies,  A  sudden  trem  -  bling  shakes  the  ground.

Say,  “Live  forever,  glorious  King,  Born  to  redeem,  and  strong  to  save!” 
Then  ask,  “0  Death,  where  is  thy  sting,  And  where  thy  victory,  boasting  Grave?”

None  of  the  books  we  have  examined  give  the  author  of  the  above  tune.  It  is  published  in  Missouri  Harmony  by  Carden,  1827  and  1837,  page  47;  in  the 
Southern  Harmony  by  Walker,  1837  and  1848,  page  53.  The  other  hymn  was  taken  from  where  it  bears  the  title,  “Qhrist  Dying,  Rising,  and  Reigning.”  The  hymn 
has  six  verses.

“I  will  rejoice  in  the  Lord.”—Haba.  3:18. 
Charles  Wesley,  1755.  Key  of  A  Major.  Meth  Hymn  Book,  p.  357. 
Come  away  to  the  skies,  My  beloved  arise,  And  rejoice  in  the  day  thou  wast  born;  On  this  festival  day,  Come  exulting  away,  And  with  singing  to  Zion  return. 
We  have  laid  up  our  love  And  our  treasure  above,  Though  our  bodies  continue  below:  The  redeemed  of  our  Lord,  We  remember  his  word,  And  with  singing  to  Paradise  go. 
We  have  been  unable  to  find  the  author  of  the  above  tune.  The  first  book  we  have  been  able  to  find  it  printed  in  is  the  Southern  Harmony  by  Walker,  1835, 
page  17.  It  has  been  printed  in  each  revision  If  The  Sacred  Harp  1844-1850  and  1869.  None  of  the  tune  books  give  the  author  of  the  music.  The  hymn  was  com -
posed  by  Wesley,  1755,  under  the  title,  “Qn  the  Birthday  of  a  Friend,”  being  his  wife’s  29th  birthday.  There  are  two  additional  stanzas.
