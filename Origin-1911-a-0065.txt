PARIS.  L.  M. 
“He  was  in  the  world,  and  the  world  was  made  by  him,  and  the  world  knew  him  not.”—St.  John  1:  10.

This  spacious  earth  is  all  the  Lord’s,  And  men,  and  worms,  and  beasts,  and  birds;  He  raised  the  buildings  on  the  seas,  And  gave  it  for  their  dwelling-place. 
“Paris”  is  one  of  the  old  melodies,  printed  in  the  “Missouri  Harmony,”  page  53,  1837,  and  many  of  the  song  books  of  the  earlier  part  of  the  nineteenth 
century.  It  has  the  same  words  now  as  in  all  the  books  in  which  it  was  published. 
VERNON.  L.  M. 
‘‘No  man  hath  seen  God  at  any  time  ;  the  only  begotten  Son,  which  is  in  the  bosom  of  the  Father,  he  hath  declared  him."—St.  John  1:  18.

“Vernon  ”  is  among  the  oldest  melodies,  and  its  composition  dates  back  to  the  first  of  the  nineteenth  century.  See  “  Southern  Harmony,”  by  Walker,  page  34, 
1835;  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  page  55,  1837.  It  appears  also  in  some  of  Oliver  Holden’s  books.
