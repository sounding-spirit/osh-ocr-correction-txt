The  original  name  of  this  song  was  “  O  Canaan,  Bright  Canaan.”  John  Wesley  tried  to  change  it  and  applied  it  to  another  song,  “  How  Happy  is  the  Pil -
grim’s  Lot.”  It  would  not  be  changed  from  the  old  air.  One  of  the  old  verses  was,  “  If  you  get  there  before  I  do,  I  am  bound  for  the  land  of  Canaan;  look  out 
for  me,  I  am  coming,  too,  1  am  bound  for  the  land  of  Canaan.”  The  original  chorus  was  “  O  Canaan,  bright  Canaan.”  It  is  a  fact  that  in  the  early  days  of  this 
song  many  souls  were  born  into  the  kingdom  of  God  by  the  sound  of  the  crude  woodland  songs.  About  1844  E.  J.  King  made  a  few  alterations  in  the  tune  and 
words,  changing  “  Bright  Canaan  ”  to  “  Sweet  Canaan.”  With  few  exceptions  the  tune  is  as  it  was  originally  written.
