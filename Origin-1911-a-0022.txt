The  natural  place  for  Me  in  the  Major  scale  is  on  B,  no  sharp  or 
flat,  thus  the  key  note  in  Major  would  be  as  follows: 
1.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  G. 
2.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  D. 
3.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  A. 
4.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  E. 
5.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  B. 
6.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  F  sharp. 
7.  Sharp  Faw  the  key  note  would  be  on  C. 
The  above  is  for  four-note  method.  If  round  or  seven-shape  headed 
notes  are  used,  Do  would  be  the  key  note  in  place  of  Faw. 
Minor  key  it  would  be  A,  no  sharp  or  flat. 
1.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  on  E. 
2.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  on  B. 
3.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  F  sharp. 
4.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  on  C  sharp. 
5.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  on  G  sharp. 
6.  Sharp  law  the  key  note  would  be  on  D  sharp. 
7.  Sharp  Law  the  key  note  would  be  on  A  sharp. 
If  the  round  or  seven-shape  notes  are  used,  the  same  key  note  Law  wilt 
be  used.  As  above,  the  key  note  is  the  same  in  four-shape,  seven-shape  or 
round  notes.
