REPORT  OF  SUB-COMMITTEE  ON  REVISION. 
We,  the  undersigned  sub-committee  appointed  by  the  general  committee  on  revision  of  the  Sacred  Harp,  respectfully  submit  the  work  performed 
by  us  in  this  volume,  to  the  general  committee,  and  believe  it  will  in  its  present  form  answer  the  great  demand  of  the  music  people  of  this  country. 
We  believe  it  contains  more  sacred  songs  and  hymns  than  any  other  sacred  tune  and  song  book  yet  published,  and  will  do  its  work  in  the  religious 
field  of  music  wherever  rendered.

STATEMENT  AND  ENDORSEMENT  BY  THE  COMMITTEE  ON  REVISION  OF  THE  SACRED  HARP,  APPOINTED  BY  THE 
UNITED  SACRED  HARP  MUSICAL  ASSOCIATION. 
After  much  unnecessary  delay  and  hindrance,  we  have  succeeded  in  having  under  our  supervision  a  final  and  complete  revision  of  the  Sacred  Harp, 
as  provided  in  the  resolutions  under  which  this  Committee  was  appointed,  and  hereby  submit  the  following  pages  embodied  in  this  volume  of  rudi -
ments  and  tunes,  believing  that  the  ‘  ‘  Original  Sacred  Harp  ’  ’  now  contains,  as  here  presented,  the  best  and  most  extended  collection  of  valuable  sacred 
tunes  and  hymns  ever  published  in  this  country.  There  is  nothing  like  it  on  the  market. 
It  is  believed  by  the  Committee  it  is  what  the  singing  public  demands  and  the  country  for  a  long  time  has  needed.  No  revision  made  by  others 
has  been  satisfactory  to  this  Committee  in  such  a  way  as  we  could  give  them  our  endorsements  and  keep  within  the  bounds  directed  in  the  resolutions 
above  referred  to.  We  have  followed  in  this  compilation,  the  letter,  spirit  and  reason  of  the  resolutions.  We  give  the  work  herein  contained,  our 
undivided  commendation  and  endorsement,  and  believe  it  will  be  well  pleasing  to  the  music  people,  and  the  medium  of  spreading  Christian  tunes  and 
hymns  so  much  needed  in  all  the  country,  and  will  be  the  means  of  building  up  and  reviving  the  spiritual  condition  of  the  churches.  Most  of  the 
work  of  compiling  the  book  has  been  done  by  a  sub-committee,  appointed  from  the  general  committee,  but  under  the  supervision  of  the  entire  com -
mittee.  For  detailed  statement  of  the  work  performed,  we  refer  to  the  introduction  of  the  book  by  J.  S.  James,  our  Chairman,  and  advise  every  one 
to  read  it,  and  see  the  value  of  the  work  done  under  the  supervision  of  this  committee. 
Respectfully  submitted,
