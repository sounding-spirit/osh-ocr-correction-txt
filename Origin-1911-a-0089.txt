The  hymn,  “  Voices  Crying  Out  in  the  Wilderness,”  is  traced  back  as  far  as  the  “  American  Vocalist.”  Both  hymns  and  tunes  have  lost  the  authors’  names, 
and,  like  many  others,  they  have  left  no  record  of  beginning  of  dates.  In  the  old  “  Sacred  Harp  ”  this  tune  is  credited  to  Thos.  W.  Carter.  Perhaps  he  may  have 
made  some  changes  in  the  tune,  so  as  to  credit  himself  with  the  changes,  but  the  melody  was  written  many  years  before  his  time,  and  was  among  the  old  tunes  that 
have  stood  the  test  through  the  ages.  It  is  a  very  fine  piece  of  music  with  which  to  stir  the  emotions  of  the  people.
