i.  How  sweet  the  name  of  Je  -  sus  sounds  In  a  be-liev-er’s  ear; 
It  soothes  his  sor  -  rows,  heals  his  wounds,  And  drives  a-way  his  fear, 
2.  It  makes  the  wound-ed  spir  -  it  whole,  And  calms  the  troubled  breast;  ’Tis  man-na  to 
the  hun-gry  soul,  And  to  thewea-ry  rest, 
And  drives  a  -  way  his  fear, 
And  drives  a  -  way  his  fear, 
It  soothes  his  sor 
rows,  heals  his  wounds,  And  drives  a-way  his  fear. 
And  to  the  wea  -  ry  rest,  And  to  the  wea  -  ry  rest, 
’Tis  man  -  na  to 
the  hun  -  gry  scul,  And  to  the  wea  -  ry  rest. 
5  Weak  is  the  effort  of  my  heart, 
And  cold  my  warmest  thought, 
But  when  I  see  Thee  as  Thou  art, 
I’ll  praise  Thee  as  I  ought. 
6  Till  then  I  would  Thy  love  proclaim 
With  every  fleeting  breath  ; 
And  may  the  music  of  Thy  name 
Refresh  my  soul  in  death. 
3  Dear  name!  the  Rock  on  which  I  build,  4  Jesus!  my  shepherd,  husband,  friend, 
My  shield  and  hiding  place;  My  prophet,  priest,  and  king; 
My  never-failing  treasury,  filled  My  Lord,  my  life,  my  way,  my  end, 
With  boundless  stores  of  grace.  Accept  the  praise  I  bring.
