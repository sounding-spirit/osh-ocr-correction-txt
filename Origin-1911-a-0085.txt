This  is  an  original  song  by  Prof.  Breedlove,  composed  especially  for  the  “  Sacred  Harp,”  and  if  ever  printed  in  any  other  book  we  have  been  unable  to  find  it. 
It  is  supposed  he  is  the  author  of  the  words  as  well  as  the  music.  In  another  part  of  this  book  other  references  will  be  found  concerning  Mr.  Breedlove. 
The  two  last  verses  are  taken  from  Horatio  Bonner’s  “  Hymn  of  Faith,”  published  in  1858.  The  title  was  “  The  Voice  from  Galilee.”
