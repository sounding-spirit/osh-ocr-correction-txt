The  above  is  a  photograph  of  Dr.  Len  G.  Broughton,  Pastor 
of  the  Baptist  Tabernacle  Church  of  Atlanta,  Ga.  He  is  also 
the  founder  and  director  of  the  Baptist  Tabernacle  Infirmary. 
Dr.  Broughton  is  one  of  the  ablest  Divines  in  America.  His 
reputation  is  not  only  confined  to  his  own  country,  but  he  often 
fills  the  pulpits  of  London  and  other  foreign  countries.  Dr. 
Broughton  and  his  large  church  membership  have  generously 
furnished  free  of  charge  their  spacious  Tabernacle  in  Atlanta 
to  the  United  Sacred  Harp  Musical  Association  for  its  annual 
meetings  from  the  time  it  was  first  organized  to  the  present.
