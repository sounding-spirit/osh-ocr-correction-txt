RUDIMENTS  OF  MUSIC.  i 
By  Joe  S.  James,  for  Original  Sacred  Harp. 
Music  is  written  on  five  equidistant,  parrallel,  and  horizontal  straight  lines  and 
the  intervening  spaces  which  is  called  a 
Staff

It  is  sometimes  called  a  STAVE. 
This  staff  can  be  enlarged  when  it  becomes  necessary,  by  adding  thereto  addi -
tional  lines  called  LEDGBR  LINES  and  their  accruing  spaces,  thus  : 
Ledger  lines  above.

NOTE.  In  reconing  the  degrees,  letters,  etc,  of  the  music  staff,  always  count 
upward. 
In  vocal  and  most  instrumental  music  there  are  FOUR  PARTS,  sometimes 
only  three,  viz:  Bass,  Tenor,  Alto  and  Treble.  These  parts  are  sometimes  called 
other  names.  When  only  three  parts  are  used,  Alto  is  generally  left  off.  These 
various  parts  of  music  are  all  included  in  a  character  placed  at  the  beginning  of  the 
composition  called  a 
BRACE.

Degrees. 
Each  of  these  lines  and  spaces  is  called  a  degree.  The  lines  and  spaces  of  the 
music  staff  do  not  only  represent  separate  degrees,  but  separate  numbers  and  dis -
tinct  sounds,  and  this  applies  to  added  lines  and  their  accruing  spaces  as  do  the  first 
five  lines  and  intervening  spaces.  There  are  therefore  NINE  DEGREES  on  this 
music  staff,  Thus: 
DEGREE  STAFF. 
On  this  staff  are  also  placed  the  first  seven  letters  of  the  alphabet,  A,  B,  C,  D,  E 
F,  G.  These  letters  and  the  staff  upon  which  they  are  placed  are  always  stationary 
If  the  seven  letters  are  not  sufficient  to  reach  high  or  low  enough  for  the  toneâ€™ 
repeat  the  letters  as  occasion  may  require,  always  in  their  regular  order.

There  are  SEVEN  PRIMARY  TONES.  For  instance  :  When  an  eighth  tone 
is  used  it  is  a  reputition  of  the  first  one  of  the  series,  it  is  called  THE  SCALE.  The 
the  tones  of  the  scale  named  from  the  FIRST  EIGHT  NUMERALS,  the  lowest  being 
ONE;  the  next  above  it  TWO;  the  next,  THREE  and  so  on.  The  highest  is  called 
EIGHT,  the  next  below  it  SEVEN;  the  next  Six;  and  so  on.  The  highest  and  lowest 
or  the  distancce  up  and  down  between  any  two  tones  is  called  an  INTERVAL. 
There  are  seven  intervals  which  are  of  TWO  KINDS,  LARGER  and  SMALLER 
The  smaller  intervals  being  only  half  as  great  as  the  larger,  they  are  called  for  the 
sake  of  convenience,  STEPS  and  HALF  STEPS.  There  being  FIVE  WHOLE 
STEPS,  and  TWO  HALF  STEPS,  the  half  steps  occur  between  THREE  and  FOUR 
and  SEVEN  and  EIGHT.  The  hnman  voice  naturally  makes  a  whole  step  from 
One  to  Two;  and  from  Two  to  Three  a  whole  step,  from  Three  to  Four  a  half  step, 
from  Four  to  Five  a  whole  step,  from  Five  to  Six  a  whole  step,  fiom  Six  to  Seven  a 
whole  step  and  from  Seven  to  Eight  a  half  step.
