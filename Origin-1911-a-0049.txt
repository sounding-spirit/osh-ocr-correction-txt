Philip  Doddridge,  D.  D.,  the  author  of  this  hymn,  was  born  in  London  in  1702,  over  two  hundred  years  ago.  He  was  a  scholar  of  high  attainments;  was 
ordained  to  the  Nonconformist  ministry;  was  an  English  Congregationalist,  and  for  many  years  was  pastor  of  one  of  these  churches—from  1829  to  the  time  of  his 
death,  1852.  He  was  a  great  pulpit  orator  and  theologian.  He  composed  many  standard  hymns  and  high-class  sacred  music. 
This  tune  is  credited  to  Bradshaw  in  the  “  Southern  Harmony,”  page  40,  and  published  in  1835,  and  refers  to  “  Baptist  Harmony,”  page  139.  No  doubt  it  was 
composed  at  an  earlier  date  than  this.  It  was  printed  in  the  “  Sacred  Harp,”  by  White  and  King,  in  1844,  and  in  each  revision  up  to  1869.

There  are  two  accounts  of  the  date  of  this  hymn.  The  “  Baptist  Hymnal,”  printed  in  1837,  gives  the  date  in  1707.  The  “  National  Hymn  Book  of  the  United 
States  ”  of  1893  fixes  the  date  of  composition  in  1762.  We  are  inclined  to  believe  the  latter  date  is  the  correct  one.  See  also  M.  E.  Church  South  Hymnal,”  page 
486,  in  1889.  See  sketch  of  Charles  Wesley,  under  tune  of  “  Arnold,”  page  274.  o  .  •  »»  ,  u,™  »  T o. T  no™  “t  1
