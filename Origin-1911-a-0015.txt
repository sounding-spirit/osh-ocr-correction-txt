RUDIMENTS  OF  MUSIC.  Continued. 
Beating  Time—Beating  time  is  done  with  the  hand,  and  according  to 
each  mode  of  time  the  beats  are  carried  on.  In  some  of  the  modes  there  are 
three  beats,  down,  left  and  up.  In  some  music  books  there  are  four  and  six 
beats  to  the  measure.  When  we  have  four  beats  it  is  down,  left,  right  and 
up.  If  six  beats,  down,  down,  left  right,  up  and  up.  In  all  of  these  different 
classifications  it  is  called  beating  time. 
Beating  time  is  indicating  each  pulsation  of  a  measure  by  certain  motions 
of  the  hand  and  is  applied  indiscriminately  to  all  kinds  of  vocal  music. 
1.  When  the  music  is  set  to  2-2,  2-4  and  4-4,  it  is  called  in  some  of 
the  books  “Common  Time.”  In  others,  “Quadruple  Time.”  When  the  music 
is  written  in  four  shaped  notes,  generally  there  are  “two  beats”  to  the  meas'- 
ure.  “Down  and  Up.”  Triple  time  three  beats. 
When  seven-shaped  notes  or  round  notes  are  used,  generally 
“four  beats”  to  the  measure.  “Down,  left,  right,  up,”  except  in  2-4,  only  “Two 
beats”  in  all  of  the  books,  “down  and  up.” 
2.  “Triple  time,”  3-2,  3-4  and  3-8  in  all  of  the  books  regardless  of  the 
shape  of  the  notes,  have  “Three  beats”  to  the  measure,  “Down,  left,  up.” 
3.  Compound  or  Sextuple  measure,  6-4,  6-8,  etc.  When  written  in  “Four -
shaped  headed  notes,”  usually  “two  beats  to  the  measure,”  and  when  in 
“seven  shaped  headed  or  round  notes,”  generally  “two  beats,”  but  some  of 
these  have  as  many  as  “Six  Beats”  to  the  measure,  but  all  can  be  sung  to 
“Two  beats”  to  the  measure.  When  “Two  beats,”  down  and  up;  when  “Six 
beats,”  down,  down,  left,  right,  up,  up,  or  down,  left,  left,  right,  right  up. 
The  different  manner  of  beating  time  is  generally  left  to  the  leader  or 
director  of  music. 
There  is  in  music  Major  key  and  Minor  key.  The  key  note  in  the  Major 
scale  is  called  a  faw,  and  in  the  Minor  it  is  called  la. 
A  key  note  is  the  Tonic  number  one  of  any  key.  First  note  of  the  Scale. 
Leading  Note  is  the  Major  seventh  of  any  scale;  the  Semi-tone  below  the 
key  note;  the  third  of  the  dominant  sub-tonic. 
From  the  Leading  note  the  Major  and  Minor  key  lead  out.  There  is  a 
difference  in  a  leading  note  and  key  note. 
The  leading  note  is  stated  above.  The  key  note  means  a  scale  or  series 
pf  notes  progressing  diatonically  in  a  certain  order  of  intervals.

The  first  note  of  the  scale  being  called  key  note. 
Where  four  notes  are  used,  Me  is  the  leading  note.  When  seven  notes 
are  used,  Se  or  Te  is  the  leading  note.  In  the  four  note  system  when  you 
find  Mi,  if  in  the  Major  key,  it  will  be  Faw,  one  degree  above  Mi.  If  Mi  is 
on  the  line,  Faw,  the  key  note,  will  be  on  the  space  above.  If  Mi  is  on  the 
space,  then  Faw,  the  key  not  will  be  on  the  line  above.  If  Mi  is  on  the 
space,  then  Faw,  the  key  note,  will  be  on  the  first  line  above  it.  If  it  be  in  the 
Minor  key,  La  will  be  the  key  note.  It  will  be  located  on  the  line  or  space 
below  the  Mi.  It  is  three  degrees  below  the  Major  key. 
Where  seven  notes  are  used,  Si  or  Te  find  Si,  if  in  the  Major  key,  the 
key  note,  Do,  will  be  the  next  line  or  space  above  Si,  one  degree  above.  If 
it  be  in  the  Minor  key,  the  key  note  La  in  the  next  line  or  space  below  Si, 
one  degree  below  Si,  and  this  same  rule  is  followed  up  as  to  each  part  of  the 
tune,  either  tenor,  treble,  bass  or  alto. 
Wherever  the  Mi  is  found  bn  the  staff  in  the  four  note  system  as  used  it 
is  Si  in  the  seven  note  system,  whether  it  be  in  seven-shape  or  round  notes. 
The  lowest  Fa  in  the  four-note  system  is  Do.  In  the  seven  or  round 
notes,  as  well  as  each  octave  above  and  below  Scale,  give  the  same  note. 
The  lowest  Sol  in  the  four-note  system  js  Ra.  In  the  seven  or  round  note 
notes,  as  well  as  each  octave  above  and  below  will  give  the  same  note. 
Scale  Exercises—The  SKIPS  most  readily  taken  occur  between  one,  three, 
five  and  eight,  and  these  are  found  illustrated  in  the  including  exercises.  They 
may  also  be  conveniently  practiced  from  numerals  written  in  tabular  form, 
applying  the  proper  tone  and  syllable  to  each  numeral  and  singing  down  each 
column  in  succession.  It  is  highly  important  that  these  skips  be  thoroughly 
learned,  and  to  insure  this  let  the  table  be  sung  through  for  several  successive 
lessons.
