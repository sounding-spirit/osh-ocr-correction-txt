THE  CONVERTED  THIEF.  C.  M.  D. 
“  And  he  said  unto  Jesus,  I,ord,  remember  me  when  thou  comest  into  thy  kingdom.”—Vuke  23  :  42. 
i.  As  on  the  cross  the  Sav-iour  hung,  And  wept,  and  bled,  and  died; 
He  poured  sal  -  va  -  tion  on  a  wretch  That  lan-guished  at  his  side. 
2.  Je  -  sus,  Thou  Son  and  heir 
of  heav’n?  Thou  spot-less  Lamb  of  God! 
see  Thee  bathed  in  sweat  and  tears,  And  wel-t’ring  in  Thy  blood. 
3.  A  -  mid 
the  gio  -  ries  of  that  world,Dear  Saviour,  think  on  me, 
And  in 
the  vic  -  tories  of  Thy  death  Let  me  a  shar  -  er  be. 
Then  turned  his  dy  -  ing  eyes  to  Christ,  And  thus  his  prayer  ad-dressed. 
His  crimes,  with  in  -  ward  grief  and  shame,  The  pen  -  i  -  tent  con-fessed, 
Yet  quick  -  lyfrom  these  scenes  of  woe  In 
tri  -  umph  thou  shalt  rise, 
Burst  through  the  gloom-y  shades  of  death,  And  shine  a-bove  the  skies. 
His  prayer  the  dy  -  ing  Je  -  sus  hears,  And  in  -  stant  -  ly 
re-plies, 
To  -  day  thy  part  -  ing  soul  shall  be  With  me  in  par  -  a  -  dise. 
The  words  of  the  above  hymn  was  taken  from  Mercer’s  “  Cluster,”  page  31,  published  in  1828  by  Rev.  Jesse  Mercer,  who  was  a  Georgian,  and  lived  and  died 
at  Powellton,  Ga.  This  was  the  third  revised  edition  of  his  book.  Its  title  was  “  Free  Grace  Displayed  on  the  Cross.  It  is  also  in  Lloyd  s  (Greenville,  Ala.) 
hvmn  book,  page  4.  We  have  not  been  able  to  obtain  the  name  of  the  author  of  the  words.  .  .. 
The  music  to  the  above  tune  is  of  long  standing,  but  none  of  the  books  we  have  consulted  give  the  name  of  the  author.  It  appears  in  Southern  Harmony, 
by  William  Walker,  1835,  page  5,  and  in  tune  books  of  an  earlier  date  than  this,
