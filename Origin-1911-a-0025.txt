SOL  MIZATION. 
Solmization  is  the  application  of  certain  syllables  or  notes  to  musical 
sounds.  The  end  proposed  by  it  is  that  the  same  name,  invariably  applied 
to  the  same  interval,  may  naturally  suggest  its  true  relation  and  proper 
sound.  The  Italians  use  for  this  purpose  the  character  or  syllables  Do,  Re, 
Mi,  Fa,  Sol,  La,  Si  (the  proper  pronounciation  being  Doe,  Rae,  Mee,  Faw, 
Sole,  Law,  See),  and  they  are  applied  in  this  order  to  the  ascending  scale, 
Si  being  the  leading  note.  In  this  country  and  in  England  four  of  these  notes 
or  syllables  only  have  been  commonly  used,  namely,  Fa,  Sol,  La,  Mi,  the  first 
three  being  repeated  and  Mi  being  the  leading  note.  However,  the  Italian 
method  has  been  preferred  by  many  composers  and  instructors.  Since  the 
shaping  the  heads  of  notes  in  this  and  the  last  century  there  has  been  a 
great  deal  of  music  written  in  the  four-shape  and  seven-shape  notes.  This 
method  is  getting  to  be  quite  popular,  especially  in  the  Southern  nad  West -
ern  states,  and  a  great  deal  of  it  in  the  Northern  states,  and  the  use  of  the 
shape  headed  notes  or  syllables  is  largely  on  the  increase  all  over  the 
country,  and  is  much  easier  learned  than  where  all  music  is  written  in  round 
notes.
