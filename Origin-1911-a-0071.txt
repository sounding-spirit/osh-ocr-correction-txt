This  tune  appears  in  “  Southern  Harmony,”  by  Walker,  1835,  page  166.  It  is  credited  by  William  Walker  to  Moore.  It  is  taken  from  “  Baptist  Har ¬ 
mony,”  page  468.  It  is  highly  probable  that  the  tune  was  composed  by  J.  W.  Moore,  of  Vermont.  He  published  an  “  Encyclopedia  of  Music,”  in  1854,  and  added 
an  edition  of  the  same  in  1876.
