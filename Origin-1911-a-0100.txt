As-far  as  we  can  ascertain  Major  B.  F.  White  composed  the  music  and  the  words  to  the  above  hymn.  This  tune  has  also  been  regularly  printed  in  the  “  Sacred 
Harp,”  in  each  edition  since  1844,  as  well  as  in  several  other  books.  It  has  some  very  sweet  chords  and  strains,  and  presents  a  strong  appeal  to  those  who  profess 
religion  to  wake  up  to  the  gospel  sound.  It  stands  very  much  as  it  did  when  first  composed.  Further  statement  of  B.  F.  White  on  page  232.
