Isaac  Watts,  1719.  Key  of  G  Major. 
PORTUGAL.  L.  M. 
“  Blessed  is  the  man  whose  strength  is  in  thee.”—Ps.  84:  5. 
Thornton, 
i.  How  pleas-ant,  how  di 
vine  -  ly  fair,  O  Lord  of  hosts,  Thy  dwell  -  ings  are!  With  long  de  *  sire  my  spir  -  it  faints, 
2  My  flesh  would  rest  in  Thine  abode, 
My  panting  heart  cries  out  for  God; 
My  God  !  my  King  !  why  should  I  be 
So  far  from  all  my  joys  and  Thee! 
4  Blest  are  the  men  whose  hearts  are  set 
To  find  the  way  to  Zion’s  gate; 
God  is  their  strength  ;  and  through  the  road 
They  lean  upon  their  Helper,  God. 
To  meet  th  ’as  -  sem  -  blies  of  Thy  saints. 
3  Blest  are  the  souls  that  find  a  place 
Within  the  temple  of  Thy  grace; 
There  they  behold  Thy  gentler  rays, 
And  seek  Thy  face,  and  learn  Thy  praise. 
5  Cheerful  they  walk  with  growing  strength, 
Till  all  shall  meet  in  heaven  at  length, 
Till  all  before  Thy  face  appear, 
And  join  in  nobler  worship  there. 
It  is  one  of  the  oldest  melodies  that  can  be  found.  Mr.  Thornton,  the  author  of  the  tune,  is  unknown.
