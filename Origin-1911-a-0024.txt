14  RUDIMENTS 
In  our  system  of  musical  notation,  the  pitch  C  is  assumed  as  a  starting  point, 
and  all  keyed  instruments,  as  pianos  and  organs  are  constructed  so  as  to  play  half 
steps  between  E  and  F,  and  B  and  C,  and  whole  steps  between  all  the  other  letters. 
Therefore,  when  the  scale  is  based  on  C,  the  Clefs  used  to  indicate  the  position 
and  order  of  the  letters,  are  sufficient  also  to  form  its  signature,  and  the  white  keys 
play  the  order  of  intervals  required  to  constitute  the  Major  Diatonic  Scale,  as  repre -
sented  on  page  7.  For  this  reason  the  key  of  C  is  frequently  spoken  of  as  the  nat -
ural  key.

All  other  keys  require  the  employment  of  either  sharps  or  flats  in  the  signature, 
as  will  soon  appear.  When  any  other  pitch  than  C  is  taken  as  One  of  the  scale,  it 
s  said  to  be  TRANS  POSED. 
as  four  degrees  below,  both  leading  to 
the  same  point  in  the  Scale,  thus: 
There  are  two  systematic  ways  of  transposing  the  scale.  One  is  by  fifths  and  the 
other  by  fourths.  To  transpose  the  scale  by  fifthsis  to  move  it  up  FIVF  Degrees 
Higher  or  FOUR  Degree  Lower,  and  to  transpose  by  fourths  is  to  move  it  up  FOUR 
Degrees  Higher;  or  DOWN  FIVE  Degrees  Lower.  Five  degrees  above  is  the  same 
Four  degrees  above  is  the  same  thing  as 
five  degrees  below,  both  leading  to  the  same 
point  in  the  Scale,  thus  : 
In  commencing  a  series  of  transpositions  of  the  Scale,  whether  by  fifths,  or 
fourths,  the  fisrt  transposition  must  be  made  from  the  key  cf  C,  and  thereafter  form 
the  last  key  obtained. 
In  transposing  by  fifths,  sharps  are  used  to  form  the  new  signature. 
In  transposing  by  fourths,  flats  are  used  to  form  the  new  signature. 
Signature  sharps  and  flats  affect  all  the  notes  of  corresponding  names,  higher  or 
lower,  unless  contradicted  by  ihe  Natural.  The  first  tramsposition  of  the  Scale,  by 
fifths  is  from  C  to  G,  We  simply  take  G  as  One  of  the  Scale  in  higher  position,  thus:
