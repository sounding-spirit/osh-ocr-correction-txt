See  remarks  about  J.  T.  White,  the  author  of  this  tune,  on  other  pages  of  these  sketches.  We  have  been  unable  to  find  the  name  of  the  author  of  the  words. 
While  they  appear  in  the  earliest  song  books  in  the  United  States,  none  of  them,  so  far  as  we  could  find,  has  given  the  author  of  the  hymn  nor  the  date  of 
its  composition.
