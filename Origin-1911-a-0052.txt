This  tune  is  on  page  42  of  the  “  Sacred  Harp  ”  as  it  was  published  in  1844.  Like  some  other  tunes,  we  have  been  unable  to  find  any  trace  of  its  histoiy 
or  the  words  in  the  tune.  It  is  a  great  favorite  among  the  older  people  who  sung  it  from  thirty  to  fifty  years  ago.  It  contains  some  very  fine  chords,  and  is 
often  requested  to  be  sung  in  conventions  and  other  musical  gatherings,  especially  by  those  who  use  shaped  note  books.
