The  above  hymn  was  written  by  Lacy  Freer  Shaffer,  of  Atlanta,  Ga.  Mr.  Shaffer  is  a  ready  writer  of  poems,  of  which  he  has  written  a  large  number. 
Sometime  in  the  future  he  intends  publishing  a  book  of  his  own  compositions.  An  inspection  will  show  they  are  first-class.  Mr.  Shaffer  was  a  boy  editor  in 
Dakota  before  the  territory  was  admitted  as  a  State  in  1886.  He  was  a  member  of  the  convention  adopting  her  constitution  on  becoming  a  State.  Before  he 
was  twenty  years  old  he  studied  the  poetical  works  of  Longfellow,  Whittier,  Meredith,  Holland,  Burns,  Bryant,  Shakespeare,  and  others.  He  has  been  engaged 
twenty-five  years  as  editor  and  publisher,  and  for  fifteen  years  has  resided  in  Atlanta,  Ga.  It  is  believed  the  above  composition  will  prove  quite  a  favorite.
