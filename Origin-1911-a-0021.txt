RUDIMENTS  OF  MUSIC.  Continued. 
one  to  two  is  a  step,  from  two  to  three  a  half-step,  from  three  to  four  a 
step,  from  four  to  five  a  step,  from  five  to  six  a  half-step,  and  from  six 
to  seven  an  augmented  second,  or  step  and  a  half,  from  seven  to  eight  a  half -
step.  The  seventh  tone  is  obtained  by  the  use  of  a  sharp.  The  descend -
ing  minor  scale  is  like  the  ascending  scale  except  from  eight  to  seven  and 
seven  to  six,  which  intervals  are  whole  steps.  (See  example  above.) 
LESSON  VIII. 
1.  If  a  sharp  is  placed  in  front  of  a  note,  what  effect  has  it? 
It  is  said  to  raise  the  pitch  of  it  a  half-step. 
2.  If  a  flat  is  placed  in  front  of  a  note,  will  it  lower  the  pitch  of  the  note? 
It  will  lower  it  a  half-step. 
3.  What  is  a  natural  for? 
It  is  to  cancel  the  effect  of  the  flat  or  sharp  and  restore  the  effected  note 
to  its  natural  or  original  pitch. 
4.  Where  do  we  find  intermediate  tones? 
At  the  five  places  in  the  scale  where  whole  steps  occur. 
5.  What  are  the  names  of  these  intermediate  tones? 
They  are  named  after  the  tone  or  note  that  lies  nearest  to  them,  thus: 
If  you  are  ascending  the  scale,  they  are  named:  Sharp  one,  sharp  two,  sharp 
four,  sharp  five  and  sharp  six.  If  descending  the  scale  they  are  named  flat 
seven,  flat  six,  flat  five,  flat  three  and  flat  two.  Sharp  one  and  flat  two  is 
the  same  tone,  sharp  two  and  flat  three  is  the  same  tone,  sharp  four  and 
flat  five  is  the  same  tone,  sharp  five  and  flat  six  is  the  same  tone,  and  sharp 
six  and  flat  seven  is  the  same  tone.

Note—It  is  claimed  by  eminent  musicians  that  our  system  of  notation 
came  from  the  Tetrachords  and  that  the  present  notes  of  the  four-note  system, 
the  seven  notes  and  the  scale,  are  the  offsprings  of  the  ancient  Tetrachordal 
method.

The  tone  upon  which  the  key  is  founded.

LESSON 
IX—TETRACHORDS. 
1.  What  is  a  Tetrachord? 
A  fourth;  also  system  of  four  notes.  Among  the  ancients  the  extremes 
of  which  were  fixed,  but  the  middle  tones  are  varied  according  to  the  mode. 
Two  chords  or  fourths  where  the  same  note  is  highest  of  one  and  the  lowest 
of  the  other. 
3.  How  was  the  tetrachord  divided? 
It  was  divided  into  two  parts,  the  upper  and  lower  tetrachord,  each 
having  four  tones  similar  to  the  scale  of  today. 
4.  Can  the  scale  be  divided  as  is  now  written? 
It  can;  and  partakes  of  the  scale  of  the  tetrachord  system. 
5.  How  is  the  octave  or  scale  divided  into  tetrachords? 
In  the  following  manner:  First,  the  first  tone  of  the  scale  is  called 
the  tonic  and  is  the  key  tone.  The  second  is  called  the  super-tonic.  The 
third  is  called  the  mediant.  The  fourth  is  called  the  sub-dominant.  The 
fifth  is  called  the  dominant.  The  sixth  is  called  the  sub-mediant.  The  sev -
enth  is  called  the  sub-tonic.  The  scale  may  be  divided  into  two  equal  parts, 
each  having  two  steps  and  one  half-step.  When  so  divided  the  divisions  are 
call  tetrachords.  The  lower  part  is  from  one  to  four  inclusive,  or  from  tonic 
to  sub-dominant.  The  upper  part  is  from  five  to  eight  inclusive  or  from 
dominant  to  tonic. 
7.  What  is  meant  by  Super-tonic? 
Tone  next  above  the  tonic. 
8.  What  is  meant  by  Mediant? 
Three  of  the  scale,  the  tone  lying  midway  from  tonic  to  dominant. 
9.  What  is  meant  by  Sub-dominant? 
Fourth  tone  of  the  scale.
