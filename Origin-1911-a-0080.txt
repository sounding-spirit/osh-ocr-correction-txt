John  Cennick  was  born  in  1718  and  died  in  1755.  He  was  an  English  Moravian,  and  published  the  above  words  in  1743,  twelve  years  before  he  died.  The 
name  of  the  song  was.  “  O  Save.”  We  have  changed  it  to,  “  Save,  Mighty  Lord.”  See  remarks  of  him  in  other  parts  of  this  books. 
J.  A.  and  J.  F.  Wade  lived  in  South  Carolina  when  they  composed  the  above  music.  Several  of  their  songs  appeared  in  “  Social  Harp,”  published  by  John  G. 
McCurry,  in  1855.  We  can  obtain  no  further  trace  of  them.  They  were  probably  brothers.  copyright,  1909,  by  j.  s.  James.
