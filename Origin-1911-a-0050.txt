1  Blow  ye  the  trumpet  blow,  The  gladlly  solemn  sound;  Let  all  the  nations  know,  To  earth’s  remotest  bound, 
2  Extol  t'he  Lamb  of.  God,  The  all  atoning  Lamb;  Redemption  through  His  blood  Throughout  the  world  proclaim; 
3  1  he  Gospel  trumpet  hear,  The  news  of  heavenly  grace;  And  saved  from  earth,  appear  before  your  Savior’s  face; 
The  year  of  jubilee  is  come  ; 
fhe  year  of  jubilee  is  come;  The  year  of  jubilee  is  come;  Return,  ye  ransomed  sin 
r  ners,  home. 
Original  title  to  tins  hymn  was  “The  Year  of  Jubilee.”  Published  in  the  author's  Hymn  Book  for  the  year  1750.  Some  authorities  have  cred -
ited  this  hymn  to  Toplady.  This  is  incorrect  for  the  reason  that  Toplady  was  not  born  until  1840,  and  could  have  been  only  10  years  old  at 
that  time.  Lewis  Edson  was  born  1746  and  died  1820.  Was  an  American  composer  of  great  ability.  Copyright  by  J  S.  James
