William  Cowper  was  born  in  1731  and  died  in  1800.  He  was  a  co-worker  with  John  Newton.  Both  Newton  and  Cowper  were  left  motherless  at  an  early  age, 
Newton  when  he  was  seven,  and  Cowper  when  he  was  six.  David  R.  Breed,  D.  D.,  in  his  work  on  the  “  History  and  Use  of  Hymns  and  Hymn  Tunes,”  says  : 
“  Newton  became  a  wild,  disbelieving  blasphemer;  Cowper  an  irresolute,  despairing,  would-be  suicide.  One  was  driven  to  Christ  by  the  violence  of  his  sins,  the 
other  by  the  violence  of  his  sufferings.  Both,  therefore,  needed  the  grace  of  God,  sought  it,  found  it,  and  sang  of  it  to  the  ages  following.”  Cowper  first  became  a 
lawyer,  but  abandoned  it  after  a  brief  practice.  He  became  one  of  the  most  distinguished  poets  in  the  English  language  in  the  latter  half  of  the  eighteenth  century. 
The  original  title  of  this  hymn  was  “  Walking  With  God.”  The  above  tune  was  first  published  in  America  by  Andrew  Law;  in  “  Missouri  Harmony,”  in  1837, 
and  in  the  earlier  editions  of  Mason’s  “  Sacred  Harp,”  in  1840,  and  in  many  other  tune  books.
