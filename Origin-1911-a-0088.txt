Daniel  Reed,  the  author  of  this  tune,  also  composed  the  tunes  of  “Greenwich,”  “Russia,”  “Sheburne,”  “Newport,”  and  “Windham.”  They  appear 
in  “Columbian  Harmony,”  1793.  See  further  statements  about  Mr.  Reed  on  page  38  under  the  tune  “Windham.” 
We  cannot  give  any  information  about  the  words  in  this  tune.  They  were  published  long  ago  in  different  books,  from  1793  to  the  present  time,  in  con -
nection  with  Mr.  Reed’s  tune,  “Stafford,”  on  this  page.
