i.  When  I  can  read  my  ti 
tie  clear  To  man-sions  in  the  skies, 
I’ll  bid  fare-well  to  ev-’ry  fear,  And  wipe  my  weep-ing  eyes, 
2.  Should  earth  a-gainst  my  soul 
en-gage,  And  fier  -  y  darts  be  hurled, 
Then  I  can  smile  at  Sa-tan’s  rage,  And  face  a  frown-ing  world, 
3.  Let  cares,  like  a  wild  del 
uge,  come,  Let  storms  of  sor  -  row  fall, 
So  I  but  safe-ly  reach  my  home,  My  God,  my  heav’n  my  all, 
4.  There  1  shall  bathe  my  wear  -  y  soul 
In  seas  of  heav’n-ly  rest, 
And  not  a  wave  of  trouble  roll,  A  -  cross  my  peace-ful  breast, 
I’ll 
bid 
fare 
-  well 
to 
ev  -  ’ry 
fear, 
I’ll 
bid 
fare-well 
to 
ev  -  ’ry  fear,  And 
wipe  my  weep-ing 
eyes. 
Then 
I 
can 
smile 
at 
Sa  -  tan’s 
rage, 
Then 
I 
can  smile 
at 
Sa  -  tan’s  rage,  And 
face  a  frown-ing 
world. 
So 
1 
but 
safe 
-  ly 
reach  my 
home, 
So 
I 
but  safe  - 
ly 
reach  my  home,  My 
God,  my  heav’n,  my 
all. 
And 
not 
a 
wave 
of 
trou  -  ble 
roll, 
And 
not 
a  wave 
of 
trou  -  ble  roll,  A  - 
cross  my  peace  -  ful 
breast.
