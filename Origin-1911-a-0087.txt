J  How  happy’s  every  child  of  grace,  Who  feels  his  sins  forgiv’n;  1  A  country  far  from  mortal  sight,  The  land  of  rest,  the  saints’  deiight, 
1  This  world,  he  cries  is  not  my  place,  I  seek  a  place  in  heaven.  J  Yet,  oh!  by  faith  I  see  A  heaven  prepared  for  me.

f  Oh,  what  a  blessed  hope  is  ours,  While  here  on  earth  we  stay,  1  We  feel  the  ressurrection  near,  And  with  His  glorious  presence  here 
I  We  more  than  taste  the  heav’nly  powers  And  antedate  that  day.  J  Our  life  in  Christ  concealed,  Our  earthen  vessels  filled.

i.  Hark!  my  soul,  it  is  the  Lord;  ’Tis  the  Sav  -  iour,  hear  His  word!  Je  -  sus  speaks,  He  speaks  to  thee,“  Say,poor  sin-ner,lovest  thou  me?  me?” 
2.  Lord,  it  is  my  chief  com-plaint  That  my  love  is  weak  and  faint;  Yet  I  love  Thee,  and  a-dore;  Oh,  for  grace  to  love  Thee  more  !  more! 
3.  Sweet  the  mo-ments  rich  in  bless-ing,  Which  be-fore  the  cross  I  spend;  Life,  and  health,  and  peace  pos-ses-sing  From  the  sin-ner’s  dy-ing  Friend.  Friend. 
4.  “Mine  is  an  un-chang-ing  love,  High-er  than  the  heights  a  -  bove,  Deep-er  than  the  depths  be-neath,  Free  and  faithful,  strong  as  death,  death.”
